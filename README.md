## __2) Lessons Learned, Technology__ ##

#### __AngularJS__ ####
I really enjoyed using AngularJS. 

Once I was comfortable with binding from the Model to the View and then passing information back to the Model everything else seemed to fall into place.
I really liked the MV* methodology and AngularJS directives.

I wish I had started using AngularJS sooner.
 
#### __Angular Material Designs__ ####
I would normally set up a grid system and simple formatting using Bootstrap, however The Angular MD was easy to use and was a new experience. 

Although I am more familiar with bootstrap I would be indifferent to whether I use Bootstrap or Angular MD for this sort of project.
